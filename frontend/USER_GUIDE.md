## Understanding Metrics

### Words Per Minute (WPM)

```
WPM = (Characters Typed / 5) / (Time in Minutes)
```

**Good targets**:
- Beginner: 20-30 WPM
- Intermediate: 40-60 WPM
- Advanced: 60-80 WPM
- Expert: 80+ WPM

### Accuracy

**What it measures**: Percentage of correct characters

**How it's calculated**:
```
Accuracy = (Correct Characters / Total Characters) × 100
```

**Good targets**:
- Minimum: 80%
- Good: 90%
- Excellent: 95%
- Perfect: 98%+

### Error Rate

**What it measures**: Frequency of mistakes

**How it's calculated**:
```
Error Rate = (Errors / Total Characters) × 100
```

**What to aim for**: < 5% error rate

### Performance Rating

Based on your WPM and accuracy:
- 📝 **Keep Practicing**: < 80% accuracy
- 👍 **Good Job**: 80-90% accuracy
- ⭐ **Great Accuracy**: 90%+ accuracy, < 40 WPM
- ⭐⭐ **Excellent**: 90%+ accuracy, 40-60 WPM
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Outstanding**: 90%+ accuracy, 60-80 WPM
- 🏆 **Master Typist**: 90%+ accuracy, 80+ WPM

## Tips for Improvement

### 1. Focus on Accuracy First

Speed comes naturally with practice. Prioritize getting characters right before worrying about speed.

**Practice Strategy**:
- Aim for 95%+ accuracy
- Slow down if accuracy drops below 90%
- Speed will increase as muscle memory develops

### 2. Proper Posture

Good posture prevents fatigue and improves performance:
- Sit up straight
- Feet flat on the floor
- Wrists level with keyboard
- Screen at eye level
- Elbows at 90-degree angle

### 3. Touch Typing Technique

Learn to type without looking at the keyboard:
- Keep fingers on home row (ASDF JKL;)
- Use correct finger for each key
- Look at the screen, not your hands
- Practice regularly to build muscle memory

### 4. Regular Practice

Consistency is key:
- **Daily Practice**: 15-20 minutes per day
- **Short Sessions**: Better than long, infrequent ones
- **Variety**: Try different themes to stay engaged
- **Track Progress**: Review metrics weekly

### 5. Learn from Errors

Use error tracking to improve:
- Check which keys cause most errors
- Practice problem key combinations
- Review error patterns in metrics
- Focus on weak areas

### 6. Use the Auto-Pause Feature

Take breaks when needed:
- Sessions auto-pause after 10 seconds of inactivity
- Press **Esc** to manually pause
- Resume when ready
- Prevents fatigue and maintains accuracy

### 7. Choose Interesting Themes

Stay motivated by learning:
- Pick topics you're curious about
- Rotate between different subjects
- Challenge yourself with new vocabulary
- Make practice enjoyable
